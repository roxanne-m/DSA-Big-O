/* Polynomial Time O(n^k) */

/* 
Has a running time that would be some input size n raised to some constant power k. 
The easiest way to understand polynomial time complexity is with nested loops. 
An algorithm that requires 2 levels of looping over an input would be O(n^2) 
while one requiring 3 levels of looping would be O(n^3).

// Time complexity grows more quickly than the size of our input.
// If we double the input size, we quadruple the running time.
